# ETL-project

In this project our group worked with three data sources to extract, transform and load information into Postgres. 

 


## Data Source: Gross national income (GNI) per capita: https://www.kaggle.com/frankmollard/income-by-country 
About this Data: Full and productive employment and decent work for all women and men,including for young people and persons with disabilities, and equal pay for work of equal value
Dimension: Income/composition of resources
Definition: Aggregate income of an economy generated by its production and its ownership of factors of production, less the incomes paid for the use of factors of production owned by the rest of the world, converted to international dollars using PPP rates, divided by midyear population.

## Data Source: Alcohol Consumption per Capita: https://ourworldindata.org/alcohol-consumption 
About this Data: To account for the differences in alcohol content of different alcoholic drinks (e.g. beer, wine, spirits), this is reported in liters of pure alcohol per year.

## Data Source: Homicide Rates 3.	https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/VC.IHR.PSRC.P5
About this data: This report displays the homicide rate per 100,000 people in each country.


## Consideration: Handling NaN for Homicide Rates & Alcohol Consumption
Some countries did not have Homicide Rates or Alcohol Consumption per Capita values available, we have replaced those values with the calculated average for each metric for the year under review (2016). If additional datapoints per country were available (e.g. population), we also could have grouped all countries by GNI and Population, then calculated the average values for each metric per bin to replace the NaNs in each bin for a more accurate estimate.
